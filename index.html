            <hr>

        <p>
            I am a second year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE" target="_blank"> School
            </a> of Engineering Education at Purdue University. </a> I am co-advised by Prof.Senay Purzer and
            Prof.Alejandra Magana under the Research On Computing in Engineering and Technology Education <a
                href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/rocketed" target="_blank">(RoCkETEd)</a> research lab. <br> <br>I
            have had
            considerable industry experience as a data analyst in a solar energy company, a software engineer in an
            information systems company, and as a programming instructor at various academic institutions. My vast
            experience of
            software engineering and data science in both industry and academia have inspired my interest and investment
            in Engineering
            Education as my way of contributing to the advancement of the quality of both Engineers and STEM Educators.
            I
            am also passionate and focused on addressing the gender gap in STEM as shown by my various mentoring and
            motivation
            efforts in different service interventions geared at increasing women in STEM.
            </br>
            </br>
            My research interests are in Computing & Data, Education Technology & Innovation, STEM Education, and
            Education for Development in Africa.

            My current research focuses on computational modeling in disciplinary undergraduate engineering courses.
            Here we try to
            understand how computing is leveraged in learning and conceptual understanding of complex problems in
            science and engineering.
            Under the RoCkETEd lab, I have contributed to two journal papers that are under review and one conference
            paper
            that is in the works for American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) 2023, among other smaller research
            projects and independent studies.
            As part of my efforts to contribute to STEM education in Africa,
            I have contributed to a conference paper for World Engineering Education Forum & The Global Engineering
            Deans Council with the African Engineering Education Association held in South Africa 2022.

            </br></br>
            I am currently open to Summer 2024 research internships to connect and learn from more industry experience.
            Thank you :-)
